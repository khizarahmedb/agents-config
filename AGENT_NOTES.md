# Agent Notes

- 2026-02-10: Bootstrap `AGENTS.md` and `AGENT_NOTES.md` immediately when this repo is created, before additional deliverables. Rationale: enforce consistent agent behavior from the first change.
- 2026-02-10: Reference shared behavior from `/Users/khizar/Documents/GitHub/AGENT_NOTES_GLOBAL.md` and keep this file repo-specific. Rationale: avoid duplication and drift.
- 2026-02-10: Any iterative change to instructions/notes must be reflected in all setup docs and pushed to `main` immediately when feasible. Rationale: keep published guidance synchronized with learned behavior.
