# Skills Index (Portable Baseline)

Use this file as a lightweight capability map. Keep it short and repo-specific.

## How to Use
1. Read this file at task start (if present).
2. Choose the minimum skill set needed for the task.
3. Prefer local skills and scripts before web research.
4. Do not load large reference trees unless needed.
5. Record stable workflow preferences in `AGENT_NOTES.md`.

## Core Software Engineering Skills
- `docs`: use for documentation creation, edits, and consistency checks.
- `testing`: use for adding or fixing tests and validating regressions.
- `review`: use for bug/risk-focused code review and release readiness.
- `refactor`: use for structural cleanup with behavior preservation.
- `security`: use when the task explicitly requests security review or hardening.
- `data`: use for SQL/pipeline/modeling tasks.
- `frontend`: use for UI/UX/accessibility and interaction issues.
- `devops`: use for CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure, and environment setup.

## Efficiency Rules
- Prefer deterministic commands and primary docs.
- Keep generated context compact; fetch details on demand.
- Use checklists for repeatable workflows (build, lint, test, deploy).
- Avoid duplicate work by reusing templates and existing scripts.
